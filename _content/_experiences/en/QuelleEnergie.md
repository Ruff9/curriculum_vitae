*Context*: QuelleEnergie is a web-based energy-saving advisory service, part of the Effy group. It puts private individuals in touch with approved craftsmen, and assists them in applying for public subsidies for their work.

I was asked to develop a new application: a tool for processing applications for public grants. This application, which has its own backoffice, is connected to several other systems via a REST API. This project centralizes CEE management for the entire group.

I deployed this application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with a Docker / Kubernetes infrastructure. This enabled the team to evaluate these technologies before migrating the group's other applications.

Due to a lack of availability in the product team, I defined most of the functionalities for this project. I also guided the technical teams towards a more agile process. I led the first retrospectives, set up daily meetings and installed tools such as Jira and Confluence. I introduced TDD and peer-programming to the team's developers.
