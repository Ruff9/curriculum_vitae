*Context* : Believe is a major French startup and market leader in the distribution of music on streaming platforms. The company acquired its American competitor Tunecore, which became the American subsidiary of the French group.

I was recruited to unify the processes between the two companies. We designed and implemented the services enabling Tunecore to use Believe's systems for music distribution.

I carried out that project alternating between the two teams, in New-York city for Tunecore and Paris for Believe.
