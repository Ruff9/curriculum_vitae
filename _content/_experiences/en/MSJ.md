*Context*: The French Ministry of Justice launched its first state-owned startup in the beta.gouv eco-system with the Mon Suivi Justice project. The problem to solve : only 50% of people summoned by a sentence enforcement judge or prison counselor showed up for their appointment.

I joined Mon Suivi Justice as the first developer. I set up the infrastructure, made the technological choices and coded the various products. Two solutions were deployed: an appointment reminder by SMS 48 hours before each appointment and an information site for convicted offenders. The SMS reminder was complemented by an appointment scheduling platform for public servants.

In the absence of a dedicated product manager, I was a driving force behind the various functionalities, and led the weekly product meeting. I trained the teams in Kanban (using Trello) and in the product creation and testing process.

I left as Lead Developer, with experience of recruiting and leading the technical team. I always kept an eye on code quality, while monitoring deployment in different jurisdictions.

Objectives have been met: the application was deployed first in the Hauts de Seine region, and absenteeism there has fallen from 50% to 20%. Users and public service employees are very satisfied with the product, and nationwide deployment is underway.
