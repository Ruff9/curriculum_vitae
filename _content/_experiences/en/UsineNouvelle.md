*Context*: L'Usine Nouvelle is a weekly business magazine specializing in industrial issues, with a website for ongoing news.

Before becoming a developer, I worked as a journalist in the web editorial department of Usine Nouvelle. I was responsible for monitoring the aeronautical and pharmaceutical industries. I was in charge of reporting, writing, editing and online publishing.

I specialized in new forms of web journalism, in particular web-documentaries and data visualization.

From this period I've kept an easy and efficient relationship style, and the habit of information monitoring.
