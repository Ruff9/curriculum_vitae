*Context*: Captive Studio is an agile web agency.

I've worked on around fifteen projects with Captive Studio. A wide variety of applications: serious games, back-offices, mobile applications, showcase sites, prototypes. I gradually built up my skills, becoming responsible for the entire scope of the projects, backend, frontend and product. I worked directly with customers, and defined specs with them.

Captive Studio was founded by an agile Extreme programming specialist. We conducted weekly retrospectives, and practiced peer programming on a daily basis. All our code was produced using TDD.

Stack : Ruby on Rails, Backbone, Refinery, Cordova, Jenkins.
