*Context*: Deliveree is a BtoB logistics platform that enables retailers to use the services of various carriers, and provides them with the necessary infrastructure.

I connected the APIs of two carriers to the platform, via connectors separate from the main code base. These libraries were delivered with unit and integration tests, and third-party API documentation on Postman.
