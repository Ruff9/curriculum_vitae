I’m a fullstack web developper with a product focus. I can handle all technical aspects of a project (frontend and backend code, devops, monitoring), and support the team with product conception if need be.

I’m used to agile environments, I learned Extreme programming at the start of my career. I’m using TDD to create stable code bases, I seek to improve communication within teams and to perfect the process.
